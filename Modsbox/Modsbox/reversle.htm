GT Project 2022: REVERSLE by Gunnar Eklund<br>
<table style="border-spacing:30px;">
<p style="font-family: serif; font-size: 12pt; font-style: georgia;"> The goal of Reversle, my exhibition (pretty much a science fair) project, was to reverse engineer the open source code of Wordle and create new variants of the game. Along with it, a major focus was that exhibition attendees would easily be able to interact with my project by playing it on the website or by scanning the QR codes on my trifold board. I am not claiming that this is my own intellectual property, for I simply modified the existing open source code for the original Wordle website (I obtained the code before the site was bought by The New York Times). Special thanks to the developers and owners of Wordle, for this project wouldn't have been possible without their original code. If you would like to learn more about the design process, either check out my <a href="https://github.com/gweklund711" target="_blank">Github</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/130CBhqWntscnPosGQe4B7Ayt9KQu9ZS1UtmKb5AsP1c/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this Google Doc</a>.</p>
<tr><td>FOURDLE</td><td rowspan="2"><a href="/FourLetterWordle/flw.html"><img src="/img/flw-screen.png" height="400px"></a></td><td rowspan="2"><a href="/FourLetterWordle/flw.html"><img src="/img/flw.png" width="200px" height="200px"></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: none; font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic;">Play the classic game of Wordle with four letter words instead. Each time you load the game a new random word is selected so you can play as much as you want.</td></tr>

<tr><td>SIXLE</td><td rowspan="2"><a href="/SixLetterWordle/slw.html"><img src="/img/slw-screen.png" height="400px"></a></td><td rowspan="2"><a href="/SixLetterWordle/slw.html"><img src="/img/slw.png" width="200px" height="200px"></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: none; font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic;">For an even harder challenge, play Wordle with six letter words. You get seven guesses now, but it's still tough. You can play this game infinitely as well, just reload the page to get a new word to guess.</td></tr>

<tr><td>STATE-LE</td><td rowspan="2"><a href="/StateAbbreviations/saw.html"><img src="/img/saw-screen.png" height="400px"></a></td><td rowspan="2"><a href="/StateAbbreviations/saw.html"><img src="/img/saw.png" width="200px" height="200px"></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: none; font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic;">For a unique challenge, try guessing a two letter state abbreviation. It's harder than you think! If you fail, just reload the page to try again.</td></tr>

<tr><td>INFINITE WORDLE</td><td rowspan="2"><a href="/WordleOriginal/wo.html"><img src="/img/wo-screen.png" height="400px"></a></td><td rowspan="2"><a href="/WordleOriginal/wo.html"><img src="/img/wo.png" width="200px" height="200px"></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: none; font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic;">For those who are fans of the classic Wordle game, enjoy the original. Only this time each time you load the page a new word is selected. Play as much as you want, not just once a day.</td></tr>
